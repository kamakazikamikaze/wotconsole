Pathway Engineering's Configuration Generator
=============================================
*Eliminating mistakes by making a developer responsible to fix them for you!*


Introduction
------------

When you've had to complete as many equipment upgrades as we have, the process
of having to generate cutsheets and new configuration files is tedious and,
well, kinda boring. "So let's automate it instead," someone said. Lo and
behold, we delivered **LIKE A BOSS**.

The Config Generator is designed to take in existing configuration files,
jack-to-port documentation, current device model and target model in order to
speed up the process of pre-configuring equipment for Next-Gen project
deployment. Hopefully we will get around to creating a Cisco-to-Dell and
vice-versa extension, but we'll that to Kent - because he slaves away his free
time to work for some strange reason.
